# Local_Adaptation_Epistasis

This repository contains the source code for the model reported in the following publication:

Jones, A. G., S. J. Arnold, and R. BÃ¼rger. 2019. The effects of epistasis and pleiotropy on genome-wide scans for adaptive outlier loci. Journal of Heredity, in press.

The source code is written in C++ and should compile using any modern compiler. A couple of shell scripts are included -- one shows how to run the compiled program from the command line and the other processes the output into a slightly more convenient format. Questions about the program should be directed to Adam Jones: adamjones@uidaho.edu.
